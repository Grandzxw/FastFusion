# FMDataset
Fast sensor Motion Dataset aims to verify the robustness of Dense-SLAM system at different velocities of sensor motion. 
It contains color images, depth images and IMUs gathered by a handheld sensor Intel realsense ZR300. We filtered depth images and saved in "filtered" file.

It has 14 sequences with 6 different scenes. Download Link:
